## Hardware
- 24" M1 iMac in mint green (2021) (the colour is very important)
- Logitech MX Keys Mini. I also have a Keychron K2 and K3 that I swap in and out, depending on my mood, but the MX Keys Mini is my daily driver keyboard.
- Apple Magic Trackpad. I can't use a mouse anymore (I am forced to when gaming, but I don't enjoy it).
- Synology NAS DS224+ keeps all my media.
- 11" iPad Pro (2020) and Logitech Combo Touch keyboard
- iPhone 15
- AirPods Gen 3
- Apple Watch SE (Gen 2)
- Supernote
- Kindle Oasis
- Kobo Libra 2
- Nintendo Switch
- ROG Ally X

- Files: [Forklift](https://binarynights.com/)
- Journalling: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). I'm calling it a "launcher" in this list because its most immediate usage is as a Spotlight replacement, but it does *so* much more.
- [Music](https://chencuifen.com/posts/owning-my-music/): Plex with Plexamp, and Apple Music
- Notes: Obsidian, with Drafts as a quick capture inbox
- Passwords: 1Password, which also holds other secure information like credit cards, passport details, software licences etc.

- Text expander: [Typinator](https://ergonis.com/typinator)
- Videos: [IINA](https://iina.io/), or Plex. I use Blu-Ray Player Pro to watch my Blu-rays on my iMac, and I think it is the best for that purpose, but that's not saying much (the field is woeful). My preferred method is to rip my Blu-rays with [makeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/) and add them to Plex.

### Utilities that run in the background and make my life easier
- [Control D](https://controld.com/personal/) blocks ads and trackers everywhere.
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai) lets me configure custom trackpad gestures (among many other things, I'm definitely underusing it).
- [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) keeps files tidy.
- [Ice](https://icemenubar.app) tidies up my menu bar.
- [Lookaway](https://lookaway.app/) reminds me to take breaks.
- [MacUpdater](https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/) keeps my apps up to date.
- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) brings up a handy emoji menu.
- [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) enables window management with trackpad gestures. I use this SO much I find it unnatural to use a Mac without it now (looks sadly at my work laptop).

## Assorted gear
- [Delter Press](https://trinitycoffee.co/pages/delter-coffee-tools) makes my coffee every day. I have an entry level electric burr grinder from DeLonghi that does the job.
- I've been travelling with a Muji suitcase for I don't know how many years and it's only needed one handle replacement (post-pandemic after atrophying in the cupboard for too long).
- [Sunnystep](https://mysunnystep.com/) makes the most comfortable shoes in Singapore!
- I have a small collection of backpacks and sling bags from [Dagne Dover](https://www.dagnedover.com/) and [Lo & Sons](https://www.loandsons.com/) that have lasted me a long time. They are a bit spendy at full price, but if you can snag them on sale they are great value for how versatile and lasting they are.
